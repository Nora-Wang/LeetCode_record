Given a non-negative integer represented as a linked list of digits, plus one to the integer.

The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list.

 

Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,4]
Example 2:

Input: head = [0]
Output: [1]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the linked list is in the range [1, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 9
The number represented by the linked list does not contain leading zeros except for the zero itself.

class Solution:
    def plusOne(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        num = 0
        while head:
            num = num * 10 + head.val
            head = head.next
        
        num += 1
        head = None
        while num:
            node = ListNode(num % 10)
            node.next = head
            head = node
            num //= 10
        
        return head
