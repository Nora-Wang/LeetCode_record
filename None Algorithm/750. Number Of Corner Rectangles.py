Given a grid where each entry is only 0 or 1, find the number of corner rectangles.

A corner rectangle is 4 distinct 1s on the grid that form an axis-aligned rectangle. Note that only the corners need to have the value 1. Also, all four 1s used must be distinct.

 

Example 1:

Input: grid = 
[[1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
 [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]]
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only one corner rectangle, with corners grid[1][2], grid[1][4], grid[3][2], grid[3][4].
 

Example 2:

Input: grid = 
[[1, 1, 1],
 [1, 1, 1],
 [1, 1, 1]]
Output: 9
Explanation: There are four 2x2 rectangles, four 2x3 and 3x2 rectangles, and one 3x3 rectangle.
 

Example 3:

Input: grid = 
[[1, 1, 1, 1]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Rectangles must have four distinct corners.
 

Note:

The number of rows and columns of grid will each be in the range [1, 200].
Each grid[i][j] will be either 0 or 1.
The number of 1s in the grid will be at most 6000.

        res = 0
        
        for left in range(len(grid[0]) - 1):
            for right in range(left + 1, len(grid[0])):
                count = 0
                for row in range(len(grid)):
                    if grid[row][left] == 1 and grid[row][right] == 1:
                        count += 1
                if count >= 2:
                    res += count * (count - 1) // 2
        
        return res
